If you register with Oracle EM, then you can manage your database in a web browser from the EM console. To register with Oracle EM, you require some details, such as OMS host name, port number, and the EM admin credentials.   
However, instead of registering from this window, you can use the discovery process in Oracle EM and add your Oracle Database as a managed target.
